<h6><b><font color="black">MARKET RESEARCH</h6>

<br></br>

<font color="black"><b>1.Information about the research

<p><font color="white">My research was conducted through interview with women; competitor’s potential customer also by observation from the 3rd of April to the 28th of may 2019.

During my research I was able to interview about 300 people who buy provision product some of whom are my competitors, potential customers, and I was also opportune to have encounter with two (2) of my competitors.
Out of the 300 people, 60% of those people express the following dissatisfaction about the provison market in the community especially the Boy’s Town area.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of customer services from competitor.</li> 
<li>Sell expire goods in the community.</li>
</ul>
<img src="woman.jpg">
<br><br>
<p>Three of the competitor I spoke to name the lack of knowledge in managing the provision market to meet the demand of their customers as a major tax to be performed in their business.<br></br> 
Due to innovation larkish in the provision market, lot of people prefer sell one product of goods.
</p>


<font color="black"><b>2.Demand

<p><font color="white">The problem or needs that have not been met is that my competitor in this location is lack of customer services. At the result people leave from the area to the Gbarnga central market to buy their product or goods.
</p>
<ul>
<li>My proposed business is to be located in the Lelekpayeh community Boy’s Town. Where more than (400) hundred people pass on a daily basis.</li>
<li>Out of the four hundred (400) people at least 200 use the path where my proposed business is to be located. Out of the total number of people who use my business path, (200) hundred including 50% interviewees promised to be my customers upon the initiation of my business.</li>
<li>My potential customer will be women, men and children.</li>
<li>With the consent of some interviewee including committed customer who use my business path; my potential customer will be not less than 200.</li>
<li>Based on the product and new goods that will be introduced, my product will be needed on a daily basis</li>
<li>Based on my research, they will afford the prices as it will be reasonable</li> 
<li>My potential customers will be willing to pay any amount that will be affordable for them</li>

<li>My competitor businesses have some level of comparison because, they all do the same provision business and have a customer based and a structure where their businesses are operating. But on the contrary they are not meeting the people need and wants.</li>
</ul>
<br></br>

My price will be posted under every product on the shelf. To have a good link and boost of my business, my potential customer will be credited with proper record system when there is need.</p>

<br></br>

<h9><font color="black"><b>BUSINESS GROWTH AND REINVESTMENT</b>

<p><font color="white">As an entrepreneur train by Mercy Crops, I will grow my business by reinvesting 50% percent of my profit for the first 6 month instead of banking or using all of it.<br></br>
By means of expansion, I will establish the business in another location after the first year of operation.<br></br> 

Considering the location or environment, I will add Sugar, Flower and Agro Oil to match with my provision business.<br></br> 

To conclude, if I need additional money to expand my business, I will prefer searching for grant opportunities instead of taking loam.
